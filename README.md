👋 Hi, I’m @b7sh

I’m a software engineer who enjoys building and improving web applications.
I’m currently working as an Odoo Developer at Plus Tech Company, creating and customizing ERP solutions.
I started my journey through the ALX Software Engineering program, and I’m always learning new things and exploring better ways to write clean, efficient code
